/* There are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits"
 *
 * 1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
 * 8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
 * 9474 = ...
 *
 * As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum is it not included.
 * The sum of 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
 * Find the sum of all numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
 *
 * Note: We must determine the upper bound of such number.
 *       Observe x9^5 must be an x digit number.
